Ballroom dancing is becoming more and more popular lately, and many have realized that it's an essential, lifelong skill. In addition to teaching ballroom, latin, salsa dancing, we also organize ballroom/latin dance outings/events almost every month (usually in Markham or Richmond Hill/Thornhill/Scarborough). We make sure that our students are able to recognize all the dances and enjoy the rhythm of every dance they study, whether Latin (such as Cha-Cha, Rumba, Jive, Salsa, Paso Doble, Samba or others) or Standard Ballroom (such as Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot, Quickstep and Viennese Waltz).

Our Dance Studio is situated at the border of Richmond Hill and Markham in the Greater Toronto Area, just North of North York, close to Toronto, Thornhill, Woodbridge, Vaughan, Scarborough, Newmarket. Dance Art Studio was founded in 2000 with the goal of promoting and encouraging **Ballroom and Latin Dancing**, and to bring the joy and exhilaration of **DanceSport** into people's lives. We offer Private, Semi-Private and Group Lessons with professional instructors in **Standard Ballroom and Latin**, including **Cha-Cha, Samba, Jive, Rumba, Paso Doble, Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot, Quickstep, Viennese Waltz**, and popular **Nightclub Dances**, such as **Salsa, Meringue and Hustle**. Preparing for your wedding? Let us help you make your first dance something to remember with our **Wedding Dance Choreography classes**.

Ballroom dancing encompasses both traditional dances, such as the **Waltz, Tango and Quickstep** - the **"Standard"** category - and latin dances, including **Cha-Cha, Samba and Jive**, which make up the **"Latin"** category. On a higher level, however, **Ballroom** branches into two distinct styles - International, consisting of **International Standard** and **International Latin**, and **American**, consisting of **American Smooth** and **American Rhythm**. **American Style** is known only in USA and Canada, but virtually unknown throughout Europe and the rest of the world - for this reason, we encourage our students to start with **International Style**, that way, they can apply their knowledge across the globe! 

**DanceSport** is a term used to refer to competitive dancing on all scales and levels. Developed originally from strictly ballroom competitions, it now encompasses any form of competitive and artistic dance performances and has grown exponentionally to become a world-recognized team sport. In competition ballroom, dancers are judged by diverse criteria such as poise, the hold or frame, posture, musicality and expression, timing, body alignment and shape, floor craft, foot and leg action, and presentation. Judging in a performance-oriented sport is inevitably subjective in nature, and controversy and complaints by competitors over judging placements are not uncommon. The scorekeepers called scrutineers will tally the total number recalls accumulated by each couple through each round until the finals, when the skating system is used to place each couple by ordinals, typically 1-6, though the number of couples in the final may vary. 

People do not stop dancing because they get older, they get older because they stop dancing. **Dancing is a great way for people of all ages to get and stay in shape.
